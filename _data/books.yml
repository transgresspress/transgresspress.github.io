  description: LETTERS FOR MY SISTERS is an anthology of collected wisdom by and for transgender women. This groundbreaking collection of letters tells raw, heartfelt stories of childhood, transitioning, and becoming women in a world where acceptance is sometimes elusive and costly.

Each writer addresses one simple question&#058; If you could write just one letter to someone beginning transition, or to your younger pre-transition self, what would you say? Would you reassure or warn them, or lay your life out in vivid detail for them to draw their own conclusions? Would you have a secret to tell, a hard-won truth or an unexpected triumph to share? LETTERS FOR MY SISTERS is an anthology of collected wisdom by and for transgender women. This groundbreaking collection of letters tells raw, heartfelt stories of childhood, transitioning, and becoming women in a world where acceptance is sometimes elusive and costly.

  description: Twenty-seven men who transitioned from female to male discuss their roles as male community members&#058; fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, boyfriends, friends, and mentors. Not since Max Wolf Valerio’s <em>The Testosterone Files</em> and Jamison Green’s <em>Becoming a Visible Man</em> has nonfiction seen such thorough and sensitive explorations of manhood, masculinity, and male embodiment—and never in a collection with such a diversity of voices. Contributors offer an incredible range of cultural, class, ethnic, spiritual, and generational backgrounds. Their work addresses topics including birthing and raising children, gay male sexuality, facing racism, and finding solace in deeply held religious beliefs. Contributors include established writers such as Valerio, Aaron Devor (author of FTM&#058; Female-to-Male Transsexuals in Society) and Ryan Sallans (author of Second Son), as well as exciting new authors.

  description: In the pages of this book you are introduced to a group of people who define and describe themselves in all sorts of ways.  What we have in common is that we were born/living with the medical condition called transsexualism/intersex.  We are sometimes private and personal about this issue in our life. We’re challenging the notion and suggesting to the larger world to allow spaces for us to be private and involved if we so choose (or not).  There are many of us, and our numbers will never be counted.  Our lives and experiences are full and varied – we thought it was time to speak for ourselves.

  description: In this compelling biography, Brice D. Smith illuminates the richness and complexity of LGBT history by reclaiming one of its most significant – and overlooked – historical figures. Female-born Lou Sullivan identified as a gay man when little was known about transgender people and gay FTMs (female-to-males) supposedly did not exist. A gay liberation veteran, casualty of the AIDS crisis, and founder of the transgender movement, Lou Sullivan unapologetically lived his truth and dedicated his life to helping others do the same. A tale of triumph and transgression, Yours in Liberation revolutionizes our understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation by contextualizing the tremendous social, medical, and personal obstacles Lou Sullivan overcame to embody his identity. This powerful narrative demonstrates why Lou Sullivan’s life and work continue to inspire us to live with integrity, embrace our authentic selves, and devote our lives to liberating one another.
