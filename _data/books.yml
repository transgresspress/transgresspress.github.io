  description: 30 years ago, the world was a very different place. That’s when Francisco Ibáñez-Carrasco, a native of Santiago, Chile, moved to Vancouver, discovered he was HIV-positive and was faced with the question of how to seize his life. In 1985 terms, he had an unsurvivable illness. In his own terms, he had new license to face his mortality with grit and dark humor.<br><br>A a no-holds-barred account of the irreverent, dirty, and illuminating escapades in Carrasco's three decades of living, working in HIV clinics, and being involved in the BDSM and fetish community. <em>Giving It Raw,</em> is the first memoir from the celebrated novelist and beloved <em>enfant terrible</em> of Canadian literature.<br /><br /><blockquote>"<em>Giving It Raw</em> reads like poetry. Whether describing childhood poverty in 1960s Santiago or sexual excess in 1980s Vancouver, Francisco Ibáñez-Carrasco creates a world at once awash in nostalgia and rooted in hard-won wisdom. The result is a kind of gritty romance, told in a style that's lilting, thought-provoking, and even a little naughty." - Brent Caderwood, author 'The God of Longing'</blockquote> - Brent Carderwood, author <em>The God of Lightning</em><br /><br /><blockquote>"A rich ethnographic fresco of our spaces from taxis to transit lines to bathhouses, and of our urban flora and fauna from sex pigs to kamikaze teen skateboarders. ... If you glance one or two moments that may seem glib or insider-ish, they are well made up for by sudden flashes of brilliance and insight that I find truly wise like the sense of friendship as affectionate co-dependency."</blockquote> - Tom Waugh, author <em>The Romance of Transgression in Canada&#058; Queering Sexualities, Nations, Cinemas</em><br /><br /><blockquote>"[Ibáñez-Carraco's 'Killing Me Softly' introduce[d] a new voice to gay fiction, seductively Latin, Poe-esquely North American, very contemporary, and seemingly utterly unafraid. Ibanez-Carrasco is someone to watch."</blockquote> - Felice Pecano, author <em>Dryland's End</em>

  description: LETTERS FOR MY SISTERS is an anthology of collected wisdom by and for transgender women. This groundbreaking collection of letters tells raw, heartfelt stories of childhood, transitioning, and becoming women in a world where acceptance is sometimes elusive and costly. Brave, boldly vulnerable and revealing, this collection adds to a growing body of literature where trans people tell their own stories as they lived them. Each writer addresses one simple question&#058; If you could write just one letter to someone beginning transition, or to your younger pre-transition self, what would you say? Would you reassure or warn them, or lay your life out in vivid detail for them to draw their own conclusions? Would you have a secret to tell, a hard-won truth or an unexpected triumph to share? LETTERS FOR MY SISTERS is an anthology of collected wisdom by and for transgender women. This groundbreaking collection of letters tells raw, heartfelt stories of childhood, transitioning, and becoming women in a world where acceptance is sometimes elusive and costly.

  description: Twenty-seven men who transitioned from female to male discuss their roles as male community members&#058; fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, boyfriends, friends, and mentors. Not since Max Wolf Valerio’s <em>The Testosterone Files</em> and Jamison Green’s <em>Becoming a Visible Man</em> has nonfiction seen such thorough and sensitive explorations of manhood, masculinity, and male embodiment—and never in a collection with such a diversity of voices. Contributors offer an incredible range of cultural, class, ethnic, spiritual, and generational backgrounds. Their work addresses topics including birthing and raising children, gay male sexuality, facing racism, and finding solace in deeply held religious beliefs. Contributors include established writers such as Valerio, Aaron Devor (author of FTM&#058; Female-to-Male Transsexuals in Society) and Ryan Sallans (author of Second Son), as well as exciting new authors.

  description: In this compelling biography, Brice D. Smith illuminates the richness and complexity of LGBT history by reclaiming one of its most significant – and overlooked – historical figures. Female-born Lou Sullivan identified as a gay man when little was known about transgender people and gay FTMs (female-to-males) supposedly did not exist. A gay liberation veteran, casualty of the AIDS crisis, and founder of the transgender movement, Lou Sullivan unapologetically lived his truth and dedicated his life to helping others do the same. A tale of triumph and transgression, Yours in Liberation revolutionizes our understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation by contextualizing the tremendous social, medical, and personal obstacles Lou Sullivan overcame to embody his identity. This powerful narrative demonstrates why Lou Sullivan’s life and work continue to inspire us to live with integrity, embrace our authentic selves, and devote our lives to liberating one another.
