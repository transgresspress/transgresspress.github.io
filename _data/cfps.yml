  teaser: Following the success of <em>Hung Jury&#058; Testimonies of Genital Surgery</em>, we have received many requests to edit a second collection of testimonies exploring this important topic. In their surgical journeys and many years after, transsexual men continue to experience growth and changes in their gender and sexual embodiment. Our experiences offer wisdom and insight into male gender identity and sexuality that readers want to know more about. For this collection we are seeking testimonies that go beyond the nuts and bolts of surgical experience (although they may include some of these details) and explore a wider range of topics and issues.

  teaser: We are seeking contributions for a book collection of essays by parents who are trans (to be published by Transgress Press) provisionally titled&#058; <em>Letters for our Children&#058; Voices of Transgender Parents</em>. In this collection we seek to expand the range of stories that reflect our relationships with our children, our place within our families, and our paths as individuals. We define “trans” broadly, welcoming contributions from parents with a range of trans identities and perspectives, including but not limited to trans women, trans men, men and women with transsexual histories and people with non-binary identities such as genderqueer, agender or gender-fluid.
