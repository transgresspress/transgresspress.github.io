								We will be having a <em>Manning Up</em> Book Launch on Tuesday, June 24, 2014 from 7:00-9:00pm EDT in Somerville, MA at the Bloc 11 Cafe.
							</p>

							<p>
								Join three trans writers – Mitch Kellaway, Nathan Ezekiel, and Justin Cascio – as they read their essays from an upcoming anthology on trans manhood and family:  Manning Up: Transsexual Men on Finding Brotherhood, Family & Themselves”!  After the reading, they will open up to questions and be available to sign book copies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Light refreshments and copies of <em>Manning Up</em> will be available.  The cafe will remain open if you want to purchase coffee or sandwiches.
